title: 9 years
description:
  - para: 9 years. What started as a thought experiment eventually blossomed and grew into a sustainable business, where experiments were the order of the day. During this time, we've experimented and learnt a ton. On technology, engineering processes, design and culture. But its now time for us to pause, reflect and search for a new direction.
  - para: We take this opportunity to thank each of our customers who placed their trust in us. We're forever grateful <i class="twa twa-lg twa-pray"></i>. The rest of this page is devoted to our remarkable team - who enthusiastically poured their creative energy into this company over the years. We'll miss you <i class="twa twa-lg twa-disappointed"></i>
