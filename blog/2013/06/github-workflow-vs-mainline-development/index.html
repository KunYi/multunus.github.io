      <p class="post-description">June 22, 2013</p>
      <p>As mentioned in an <a href="http://www.multunus.com/2012/05/introduction-to-continuous-delivery/">earlier post</a>, Continuous Delivery means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of the application - any time the team makes a change to code, infrastructure or the configuration of the application</li>
  <li>Repeatable and reliable process for releasing software using one step (and perhaps push-button) deployments</li>
</ul>

<p>To achieve the above we need extensive automation of all possible stages of the delivery process, using something called as 
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html">Deployment Pipeline</a>.</p>

<p>The image below should explain the workflow of continuous delivery:
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/multunus-images/cd_workflow.png" alt="Continuous Delivery Workflow" /></p>

<p>To achieve the above, the following are mandatory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automated Tests</li>
  <li>Continuous Integration (which should run all the automated tests whenever any change is made to the codebase)</li>
  <li>Mainline/Trunk based development - to avoid Merge Issues and Continuous Integration</li>
  <li>Feature Toggling - ability to turn a feature on/off on a specified environment</li>
  <li>Automated Deployment Scripts</li>
  <li>Automated Provisioning of Servers</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is a comparison of GitHub style workflow with Mainline development and how the Review process in the GitHub style workflow affects Continuous Delivery.</p>

<h2 id="github-workflow">GitHub Workflow</h2>

<p>The following is the normal GitHub workflow:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4012/4702060815_b21642330a_o.jpg" alt="Github Workflow" /></p>

<p>The above workflow ensures the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The master is always deployable</li>
  <li>The Code Review happens for every change</li>
</ul>

<p>But inhibits Continuous Delivery because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apart from setting up Continuous Integration for master, we will have to set it up for each branch, otherwise the “feedback” will not be received.</li>
  <li>This does not guarantee “production-readiness” of the application because the commits happen to multiple branches in isolation</li>
  <li>The “review and approval” process can not be automated and will affect the frequency of the deployment if there is a manual dependency.</li>
  <li>Merge clashes can be more if branch and master does not get merged frequently and these can result in merge “hells”</li>
  <li>Deployment Pipeline becomes complicated to design because we need to have multiple jobs depending upon how many branches we have</li>
</ul>

<p>Does that mean that code review is an anti-pattern for Continuous Delivery? Not Really. Code review is good. Its so good that we should be doing it <strong>continuously</strong> .The following can help you to achieve that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pair Programming - the code gets reviewed constantly</li>
  <li>TDD (Test Driven Development which is also called as Test Driven Design) - Tests forces the developers to “Refactor” the code which helps in better code design and more maintainable code</li>
  <li>Code Quality Analysis Tools - To get feedback on code quality and “Refactor” accordingly. Tests give the confidence for developers to Refactor the code.</li>
  <li>Review commits by a senior developer. If she finds a bad commit, pair with the person who committed it to help them clean the code up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above is aligned with the principle <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/8-principles-continuous">Build Quality In</a>, which emphasises that “Every team member is responsible for Quality”.</p>

<h2 id="feature-toggles">Feature Toggles</h2>
<p>One reason for using Branches is to avoid dependencies on work-in-progress items - when there are expedites, for example. But this problem can also be solved without Branches using what is called <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggling</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll go one step further at this point and say that that Feature Toggling is a much better to solve the problem of dependencies - because the toggles can also be used in production - for testing new features with a smaller audience of users - and rolling out the features to a larger audience once the initial feedback has been processed.</p>

<h2 id="final-note">Final Note</h2>
<p>The GitHub style workflow makes perfect sense for Open Source projects - to bring in some amount of rigor to the 
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar</a>. But in a more controlled environment, relying on interdependence within the team itself for code reviews (with pair programming and TDD) makes more sense.</p>
